# Component Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the component architecture of the project. Components are distinct, modular parts of the application that encapsulate specific functionality and manage their own state and dependencies.

## Component Definition
A component in this project is defined as an independent, reusable block of code that interacts with other components through well-defined interfaces. Components can be classes, libraries, services, or other logical groupings of functionality.

## Key Principles
- **Encapsulation**: Each component is self-contained and controls its own data and behavior.
- **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reused in different parts of the application, without modification.
- **Interoperability**: Components communicate with each other through interfaces and shared services, minimizing direct dependencies.

## Component List and Descriptions

### 1. Calculator
- **Purpose**: Handles basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Interactions**:
  - Receives input from the user interface.
  - Sends calculation results to the Logger component.
- **Files**: `Calculator.cpp`, `Calculator.h`

### 2. Logger
- **Purpose**: Records operations performed by the Calculator and other components, providing a history of actions for debugging and audit purposes.
- **Interactions**:
  - Receives data from the Calculator and Notifier components.
  - Writes logs to the file system or a remote logging service.
- **Files**: `Logger.cpp`, `Logger.h`

### 3. Notifier
- **Purpose**: Sends alerts when certain thresholds are reached in calculations or other monitored activities.
- **Interactions**:
  - Monitors outputs from the Calculator component.
  - Sends notifications via email, SMS, or other communication channels.
- **Files**: `Notifier.cpp`, `Notifier.h`


## Guidelines for Adding New Components
When adding a new component to the project, follow these steps:
1. **Define the Component**: Outline the purpose, responsibilities, and interfaces of the new component.
2. **Document the Component**: Update this document to include the new component, detailing its interactions and the files involved.
3. **Integrate the Component**: Ensure the new component is fully integrated with existing components, modifying interfaces if necessary.
4. **Test the Component**: Write comprehensive tests for the new component to verify its functionality and interactions.

## Conclusion
This architecture is designed to ensure that our project remains modular, maintainable, and scalable. By adhering to the outlined component structure, we can facilitate easier updates, enhancements, and debugging throughout the application lifecycle.
